# Note: This is a local trust list for GenSnitch.
# "Unknown trust" means the signer is not in this list, NOT that the signature is invalid.
# A valid signature from an unknown issuer simply means we haven't vetted that issuer.
#
# To add a trusted issuer:
# 1. Get the SHA-256 fingerprint of their certificate
# 2. Add it to this file (lowercase hex, no colons or spaces)
# 3. Rebuild the extension
